# WeatherApp
Tkinter driven weather application

__version__: '2.0' # REV Date Feb 22nd, 2022: Added URL link for fail condition.

# NOTE: For this to work you must have the requests python module
# installed. Do this from command line or terminal:
# python -m pip install requests OR python3 -m pip install requests

The purpose of this app is to learn the use of Tkinter in creating GUI accessible user applications. This
project branched off from one of the SallyV3 chat features and was spun out into a stand alone app.

When packaged as an exe, runs without user seeing the CMD.

Desired revisions:
- More appealing window backgrounds. Current placeholder colours not visually appealing.
- Introduction of animated elements matching returned JSON data for weather description
